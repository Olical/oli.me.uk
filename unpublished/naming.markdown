I love verbose names in JavaScript, or any language for that matter. Sadly I see a lot of people yearning for short and obscure method names for no real reason. I can only imagine it's because the API documentation looks cool in their opinion with no method name being longer than five characters.

I hope to show a few people the errors of their ways with this post; using longer and descriptive method or variable names solves a lot of issues very elegantly. I'll try as hard as I can to not turn this into an aimless rant.
