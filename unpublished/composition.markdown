Whenever I dive into a frontend \*VC project of my own I always end up getting frustrated at the framework selection stage. I quite like aspects of Backbone et al, but none of them feel like that exact thing I'm looking for. This leaves me with three choices; put up with the little things that annoy me about a given framework, write my own *or* compose my own from smaller libraries.

I find this second approach **really** appealing and I'll probably put it into practice soon. One of the many reasons that I am drawn to composing my own framework (possibly on a per-project basis) is the similarities between that and the Unix philosophy.

{% blockquote Doug McIlroy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy The Unix philosophy%}
This is the Unix philosophy: *Write programs that do one thing and do it well*. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

I want my router, MVC and templating modules to do one thing and do it well.
