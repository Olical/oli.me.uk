Hi there, I'm Oliver Caldwell. I am a developer who specialises in frontend technologies, living and working around London. My [StackOverflow careers profile](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/olivercaldwell) will probably give you a good idea as to what I enjoy working with.

In short: I love all things open source and enjoy writing *good* JavaScript (yes, there is such a thing). A love for programming in general and a thirst for knowledge provide the motivation I carry through into my work. I adore what I do, hopefully that shows.

If you want to know a little bit more about me, I am sure my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OliverCaldwell), [GitHub](https://github.com/Wolfy87) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/455137/olical) accounts should suffice. If not, why not get in touch. You can contact me through most of the sites I just linked to, or you can drop me an email with **olliec87** which is hosted on **gmail.com**. I thought I should split that up a little to at least avoid *some* of the spam.
