I've always struggled to find interesting topics to write about that will still teach me something. I've never been interested in the "10 functions you didn't know existed but could of found through [MDN][] anyway" posts, so I've decided to look for something a little different.

I tried to solve some problems within [Project Euler][euler] a long time ago using any language I could get my hands on other than JavaScript. Since I've had a sudden interest in writing stuff and learning more about the algorithm side of programming, I thought I'd give it a go. So, without further ado, here's my first Euler problem, with *many* more to come.
