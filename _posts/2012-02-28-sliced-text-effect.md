I am a huge fan of Terry Pratchett's discworld books. At one point in the series Death, with his scythe so sharp it can cut sound, manages to slice words on the page into separate letters. The resulting effect on the page looked strange but brilliant. I thought I would try and recreate that effect. And here is what I came up with.

<iframe height='180' class='example' src='/examples/sliced-text/complete.html'>.</iframe>

I am afraid the technique is a little manual so it requires some playing about with pixels. So this is not really feasible for variable length text. Unless you can work something out that I could not of course.
