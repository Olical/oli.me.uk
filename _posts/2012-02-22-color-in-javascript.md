Quite a while ago I wrote some JavaScript to help with manipulating colors. I wrote it before I perfected the way I wrote classes and JavaScript in general. That means that it is pretty shabby in comparison to what I can do now. Here is [Color in it's old form](https://github.com/Wolfy87/Color/tree/45a83fecda62c086e788895182e403a9c9b42807). I say old because I am going to rewrite it. This time using classes, making it run in a browser or a server, and having it validate in [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/). I will probably even drop it in [NPM](http://npmjs.org/).
