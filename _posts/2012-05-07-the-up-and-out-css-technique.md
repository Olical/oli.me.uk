Ever wanted to overlay elements? You can create great effects and produce a really engaging site by simply making `div`s overlap slightly. But sometimes making elements lay on top of each other is harder than you would think. One of the biggest problems people have when overlaying elements on top of each other seems to be z-index issues. Luckily I am here to show you the perfect way to overlay elements with no z-index woes.

### A note on the delay

Sorry about the delay between this post and the last. I have had quite a bit on. If you have waited it out, thank you, I appreciate your patience. I have two or three ideas already lined up so the next posts should be a lot quicker. Until next time!
