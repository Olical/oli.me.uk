Ever wanted to overlay elements? You can create great effects and produce a really engaging site by simply making `div`s overlap slightly. But sometimes making elements lay on top of each other is harder than you would think. One of the biggest problems people have when overlaying elements on top of each other seems to be z-index issues. Luckily I am here to show you the perfect way to overlay elements with no z-index woes.

## An example

You may be wondering what on earth a negative margin looks like. Well take the new look of a Facebook profile for example. You see the way the smaller image pushes up into the larger one? That is the kind of effect you would be aiming for with a negative margin. Although I think Facebook are using a slightly different method. Saying that, I can see that they do use a negative margin, just not how I would have.

So you use it when you want an element to either pull it's self upwards or drag it's self downwards over other elements. I will show you how to accomplish something similar to the Facebook header but full width which makes for a great blog post style.

### A note on the delay

Sorry about the delay between this post and the last. I have had quite a bit on. If you have waited it out, thank you, I appreciate your patience. I have two or three ideas already lined up so the next posts should be a lot quicker. Until next time!
