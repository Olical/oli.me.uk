For those of you that have not heard of the flexible box model, brace yourselves. When it is more widely supported you will no longer need to silently (or audioably) scream to yourself when vertically centering a variable height block level element.

But it does more than just center any way you want. It also allows you to center multiple elements and space them how you want. It may sound too good to be true, but it is not (for once). It is just a little... new. So please keep that in mind when considering using it.

## Get stuck in with flexbox

Please bear in mind that I am using [prefixfree](https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree) on this site, so I don't have to worry about vendor prefixes. However, **you do**. Fear not, if you do not want to include prefixfree in your code you can run your flexbox CSS through [prefixr](http://prefixr.com/). It is the web app equivalent of prefixfree.
