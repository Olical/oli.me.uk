# [Oli.me.uk](http://oli.me.uk/)

This is the repository for my personal blog, feel free to poke around. I'm using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) as a platform.

If you spot something that's not quite right then it would be great if you could let me know somehow. Ideally via [the issues page](https://github.com/Wolfy87/oli.me.uk/issues).
